  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: October 17, 2025</p>

  <div class="box">
    <p><strong>BrightBins Sprint</strong> (the “App”) is a mobile application developed by <strong>Battung Daniela</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”). We respect your privacy and process data transparently and minimally—only as needed to operate the App and comply with Apple’s platform requirements.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>1. Scope</h2>
  <p>This Policy explains what data the App may process on Apple devices, how that data is used, shared, and protected. By using the App, you agree to this Policy.</p>

  <h2>2. Data We Process</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Data you provide</strong>: support requests, feedback, attachments, and any information you knowingly send to us via email or contact forms.</li>
    <li><strong>In‑App Purchases (if applicable)</strong>: purchase facts and subscription status. <em>We do not receive your payment card details</em>; payments are processed by Apple via the App Store.</li>
    <li><strong>Apple diagnostics and analytics</strong>: aggregated crash/diagnostic and performance reports Apple may provide to developers (e.g., App Store Connect Analytics). These reports do not directly identify you and are used only to improve stability and quality.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We <strong>do not</strong> collect advertising identifiers (IDFA), precise geolocation, or the contents of your personal files/media outside the App’s core functionality. We do not share data with third‑party ad networks.</p>

  <h2>3. Purposes of Processing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and improve the App’s functionality;</li>
    <li>Offer user support and respond to requests;</li>
    <li>Process purchases and restore access to previously purchased features;</li>
    <li>Comply with legal obligations and Apple platform requirements.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Legal Bases</h2>
  <p>We process data based on: (i) performance of a contract with the user (providing the App), (ii) our legitimate interest in improving stability and quality, and (iii) legal obligations (e.g., accounting/tax records of purchases).</p>

  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain data only as long as necessary for the purposes above: correspondence until a request is resolved and for a reasonable archival period; purchase records for legally required periods. Anonymous diagnostic reports may be retained by Apple under their policies.</p>

  <h2>6. Sharing with Third Parties</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Apple</strong> — billing and distribution via the App Store, analytics and diagnostics reports.</li>
    <li>Service providers (e.g., email/support tools), if and when used. We require them to maintain appropriate confidentiality and security.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not sell personal data and do not share it for targeted advertising.</p>

  <h2>7. Security</h2>
  <p>We use reasonable organizational and technical safeguards. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure.</p>

  <h2>8. Children</h2>
  <p>The App is not directed to children under 13. If you believe a child provided us data without parental consent, contact us and we will delete such data.</p>

  <h2>9. Your Rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, restrict processing, or obtain a copy of your data. To exercise these rights, contact us using the email below.</p>

  <h2>10. International Transfers</h2>
  <p>Processing may occur on servers and by providers outside your country. Where applicable, we implement appropriate safeguards for cross‑border transfers.</p>

  <h2>11. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this Policy or our data practices, contact us at <a href="mailto:reniecarrie31496@gmail.com">reniecarrie31496@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Policy from time to time. The current version is available at this link; the update date is shown at the top.</p>
